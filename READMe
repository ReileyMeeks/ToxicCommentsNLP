I used PyCharm Professional to run this project. While Google Colab, Jupyter NoteBook, or other NoteBook capable services should work just fine, 
this was run and tested using PyCharm. 

Python 3.9 was used.

All imports can be downloaded inside of PyCharm or using the terminal in PyCharm using pip or conda. 

The data sets must be downloaded from Kaggle. The needed links and data to download are in the project. 
The data is free and open sourced.
This code is free for copy, and use. It is open source.
The code has no known issues, however, it is sold free as is.
